The value of $f(2)$ can be found by substituting 2 for x in the given equation $f(x) = x + 7$, which yields $f(2) = 2 + 7$, or $f(2) = 9$. The value of $g(2)$ can be found by substituting 2 for x in the given equation $g(x) = 7x$, which yields $g(2) = 7(2)$, or $g(2) = 14$. The value of the expression $4f(2) − g(2)$ can be found by substituting the corresponding values into the expression, which gives $4(9) − 14$. This expression is equivalent to $36 − 14$, or 22. Distractor Explanations: Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $f(2) − g(2)$, not $4f(2) − g(2)$.

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice A is correct. The given graph is a line, and the slope of a line is defined as the change in the value of y for each increase in the value of x by 1. It’s given that y represents the total cost, in dollars, and that x represents the number of games. Therefore, the change in the value of y for each increase in the value of x by 1 represents the change in total cost, in dollars, for each increase in the number of games by 1. In other words, the slope represents the cost, in dollars, per game. The graph shows that when the value of x increases from 0 to 1, the value of y increases from 100 to 125. It follows that the slope is 25, or the cost per game is $25. Thus, the best interpretation of the slope of the graph is that each game costs $25. Distractor Explanations: Choice B is incorrect. This is an interpretation of the y-intercept of the graph rather than the slope of the graph. Choice C is incorrect. The slope of the graph is the cost per game, not the cost of the video game system. Choice D is incorrect. Each game costs $25, not $100.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The slope of a line represents the rate of change, which is the change in the vertical axis (y) for each one-unit change in the horizontal axis (x). In this context, y is the total cost and x is the number of games. Therefore, the slope represents the 'cost per game'. To calculate the slope, pick two points on the line, such as $(0, 100)$ and $(4, 200)$. Slope = $\\frac{\\text{change in y}}{\\text{change in x}} = \\frac{200 - 100}{4 - 0} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25$.

Because the output of the function decreases by a constant percentage for each 1-unit increase in the value of x, this relationship can be represented by an exponential function of the form $f(x) = a(b)^x$...Because $f(0) = 86$, the value of a must be 86. Because the value of $f(x)$ decreases by $80\\%$ for each 1-unit increase in x, the value of b must be $(1 − 0.80)$, or 0.2. Therefore, the function f can be defined by $f(x) = 86(0.2)^x$. Substituting 2 for x in this function yields $f(2) = 86(0.2)^2$, which is equivalent to $f(2) = 86(0.04)$, or $f(2) = 3.44$. Either 3.44 or 86/25 may be entered as the correct answer.",

Alternatively, using the formula $f(x) = a(b)^x$, where $a=86$ and $b=(1-0.80)=0.2$, we get $f(2) = 86(0.2)^2 = 86(0.04) = 3.44$.

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is correct. It’s given that the measure of arc AB is 45° and the length of arc AB is 3 inches. The arc measure of the full circle is 360°. If x represents the circumference, in inches, of the circle, it follows that $\\frac{45°}{360°} = \\frac{3 \\text{ inches}}{x \\text{ inches}}$. This equation is equivalent to $\\frac{45}{360} = \\frac{3}{x}$, or $\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 8x yields $1(x) = 3(8)$, or $x = 24$. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is 24 inches.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The ratio of an arc's central angle to the full circle's angle ($360^\\circ$) is equal to the ratio of the arc's length to the full circumference. Let C be the circumference. The central angle of arc AB is $45^\\circ$. So, $\\frac{\\text{Arc Angle}}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{\\text{Arc Length}}{C}$. This gives $\\frac{45}{360} = \\frac{3}{C}$. Simplify the fraction: $\\frac{45}{360} = \\frac{1}{8}$. So, $\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{C}$. Cross-multiply to solve for C: $1 * C = 3 * 8$, which means $C = 24$.",
    "feedback_a": "This is incorrect. This is the given length of the arc, not the full circumference.",
    "feedback_b": "This is incorrect. This may result from assuming the arc is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the circumference instead of $\\frac{1}{8}$.",
    "feedback_c": "This is incorrect. This may result from assuming the arc is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the circumference, or from miscalculating $3*8$.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. The $45^\\circ$ arc is $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the full $360^\\circ$ circle, so the full circumference must be 8 times the arc length, which is $8 * 3 = 24$ inches."

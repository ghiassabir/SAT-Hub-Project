# Sentences & Fragments (Summary & Key Notes)

Hey SAT Grammar Aces! This document combines key takeaways and detailed notes. Mastering this is foundational for the Digital SAT Writing section!

## I. The Absolute Core: What is a Sentence?

A grammatically complete sentence (also known as an **Independent Clause**) MUST have two essential components:

1.  A **Subject:** Who or what the sentence is about (the performer of the action or what is being described).
2.  A **Conjugated Verb:** A verb that shows tense (past, present, future) and agrees in number with its subject.

> **💡 Conceptual Example:** Think of "The cat naps." Subject = cat, Conjugated Verb = naps.
> *(This uses Markdown blockquote. For the original colored box styling, css/style.css would need to style blockquotes or a custom div class if we choose to keep divs in the MD for special styling, though pure MD is cleaner).*

> **❗ Crucial SAT Point:** Whether a statement "makes sense" on its own or seems logical out of context has NO bearing on whether it's a grammatically complete sentence. Focus strictly on the subject and conjugated verb.
> *(Again, blockquote for emphasis. Specific red styling would need CSS targeting).*

## II. Common Types of Fragments (Incomplete Sentences) to Watch Out For on the SAT

*   ### 1. Missing Subject or Verb (or Both)
    The most fundamental type of fragment. Always check for both key components.

*   ### 2. Prepositional Phrases Standing Alone
    Phrases beginning with prepositions (e.g., **in, on, at, to, from, with, for, by, around, under, over, through**) describe relationships, often of location or time.

    > **❗ Rule:** A prepositional phrase by itself is **always a fragment**. It must be attached to an independent clause.

    *Fragment example:* "Under the old oak tree."

    > **🖼️ Visual to keep in mind:** Imagine these phrases as descriptive add-ons; they need a main sentence structure to attach to.

*   ### 3. "Group" Pronouns with "of which" or "of whom"
    "Group" pronouns include words like **many, most, some, several, few, all, none, any, each, every, both**.

    **Sentence Structure:** Pronoun (of them/us/you) + Conjugated Verb.
    *Example:* "Many (of them) believe in the cause." (Sentence)

    > **❗ Fragment Structure (SAT Trap!):** Pronoun + **of which / of whom** + Verb. These constructions create dependent clauses, which are fragments if they stand alone. This is a frequently tested SAT concept.

    *Fragment example:* "Several of which were fascinating." (Needs to be connected to an IC)

*   ### 4. Non-Essential Clauses and Appositives Standing Alone (or Incorrectly Terminated)
    **Non-Essential Clauses:** Often begin with "w-words" like **which, who, whom, whose, where** (when not forming a question or acting as the subject of a noun clause). These add extra information and are usually set off by commas within a sentence. If such a clause stands alone, it's a fragment.
    *Fragment example:* "Which was painted by a famous artist."

    **Appositives:** A noun or noun phrase that renames or further identifies another noun right beside it. Appositives alone are fragments.
    *Fragment example:* "A renowned scientist and author."

    **Sentence Ending Too Soon:** If a main sentence sets up a non-essential element with a comma but then stops immediately after that element without completing the main thought, it becomes a fragment.
    *Fragment example:* "The book, a national bestseller."

*   ### 5. Participial Phrases and -ING Words Used Incorrectly
    **Participles:** Verb forms acting as adjectives.
    *   Present Participle: Ends in **-ing** (e.g., *running, singing*).
    *   Past Participle: Often ends in **-ed** or **-n** (e.g., *painted, broken, grown*).

    **Participial Phrase:** A phrase starting with a participle that modifies a noun or pronoun.

    > **❗ Rule:** A participial phrase by itself is **always a fragment**.

    *Fragment example:* "Running quickly down the path."
    *Fragment example:* "Written by a famous author."

    **-ING Words as Main Verbs (The Conjugation Trap!):**
    An "-ing" word (whether a present participle or a gerund - an -ing noun) is NOT a conjugated verb on its own. To be a main verb in a clause, it requires a **helping verb** (e.g., *is running, was written, have been studying*).

    > **❗ Critical Rule:** A clause with a subject and an -ING word but NO helping verb is a **fragment**.

    *Fragment example:* "The team practicing for the championship."

    > **❗ SAT Red Flag - "BEING":** The word "BEING" (the gerund form of *to be*) in an answer choice often signals a fragment or an unnecessarily wordy and awkward construction. Be very wary of it; conjugated forms like *is, are, was, were* are usually preferred.

*   ### 6. Clauses Starting with a Coordinating Conjunction (FANBOYS) Alone
    **Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):** **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o.
    These are used to connect two independent clauses (IC, FANBOYS IC).

    > **❗ Rule:** A clause that *begins* with a FANBOYS word but is not properly joined to a preceding independent clause (or does not form part of a compound structure within a single IC) can be a **fragment**.

    *Fragment example (if it's the whole statement):* "But the weather was too cold."

*   ### 7. Dependent Clauses Starting with Subordinating Conjunctions Alone
    **Subordinating Conjunctions:** Words like **although, because, if, when, since, while, after, before, unless, until, as, despite, even though** etc.
    These words introduce **dependent clauses**. A dependent clause has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone as a sentence.

    > **❗ Rule:** A dependent clause by itself is **always a fragment**.

    *Fragment example:* "Although the team played well."

## III. Modifiers that DON'T Change Sentence Status

**Adverbs:** Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (many end in **-ly**, e.g., *quickly*; adverbs of time, e.g., *now, often*; transitional adverbs, e.g., *however, therefore*).

> **🔑 Key Principle:** Adverbs (including transitional phrases) provide additional meaning but **do not affect** the grammatical completeness of a sentence. A sentence remains a sentence with or without them; a fragment remains a fragment.

## IV. General SAT Strategy for Sentences & Fragments

> **🎯 Core Check:** For any group of words, always identify the main **Subject** and its main **Conjugated Verb**.
>
> **✂️ Simplify:** Mentally (or literally, by bracketing) set aside prepositional phrases, non-essential clauses/appositives, and introductory participial phrases to find the sentence's core.
>
> **🔍 Punctuation Awareness:** Understanding sentence boundaries is crucial for correctly answering SAT questions about commas, semicolons, colons, and periods, especially those testing run-on sentences and comma splices.
> *(The original used custom list bullets; Markdown uses standard ones. Styling of blockquotes for tip/alert boxes will be handled by css/style.css).*

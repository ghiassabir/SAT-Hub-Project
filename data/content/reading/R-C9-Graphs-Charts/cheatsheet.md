# Sentences & Fragments (Cheat Sheet)

Hey SAT Grammar Whiz! Quick rules for acing Sentences & Fragments questions.

## <span style="color: #0073cf;">📜</span> What MAKES a Sentence? (The Golden Rule!)

**Subject** (Who/What) + **Conjugated Verb** (Action/State of Being with Tense) = **Complete Sentence** (Independent Clause)

> **💡** Meaning doesn't matter for completeness! "It grows." is a sentence if "It" is the subject and "grows" is the verb.

## <span style="color: #ee0612;">🚫</span> Common FRAGMENT Types (Incomplete Sentences):

1.  **Missing Subject or Conjugated Verb:**
    *Ex:* "Running down the street quickly." (Who is running? Or is "running" an adjective?)
2.  **Prepositional Phrase Alone:** (Starts with *in, on, at, to, for, with, by, from, around,* etc.)
    *Ex:* "In the big green house by the lake."
3.  **Pronoun + "of which" / "of whom":** (These start dependent clauses)
    "Many **of them** are ..." = SENTENCE
    "Many **of which** are ..." / "Most **of whom** believe ..." = FRAGMENT
4.  **Non-Essential Element Alone / Sentence Ends After It:**
    *Which/Who/Whose/Where clauses (not questions):* "Which was very popular among students." = FRAGMENT
    *Appositives (renaming phrases):* "A popular action movie with great reviews." = FRAGMENT (if it's just describing something without a main clause)
5.  **-ING Word as Main Verb (NO Helping Verb):** An -ING word needs a helper (*is, are, was, were, has been*) to be a full verb.
    *Ex:* "The students studying diligently for the upcoming SAT." (Fragment - needs "are studying" or similar)
    > **❗ Trap!** "BEING" is usually a trap! Often creates fragments or awkward phrasing.
6.  **Participial Phrase Alone:** (Phrase starting with an -ing or -ed/-en verb form acting as an adjective)
    *Ex:* "Having studied all night for the exam."
7.  **FANBOYS Clause Alone:** (Clause starting with *For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So* not properly joined to another independent clause)
    *Ex:* "And he went to the store to buy milk." (Fragment if this is the entire statement without a preceding IC)
8.  **Subordinating Conjunction Clause Alone:** (Clause starting with *because, although, if, when, since, while,* etc.)
    *Ex:* "Although he was very tired after the long day." (Fragment - this is a Dependent Clause)

## <span style="color: #0073cf;">⚙️</span> Modifiers that DON'T Change Sentence Status:

**Adverbs** (*slowly, now, however, currently, therefore*): They add detail but don't make/break a sentence's grammar.

## <span style="color: #0073cf;">🔗</span> Joining Clauses Correctly (Preview!):

*   IC **.** IC (Two separate sentences with a period)
*   IC **;** IC (Semicolon joins two related independent clauses)
*   IC **, FANBOYS** IC (Comma + Coordinating Conjunction joins two independent clauses)
*   DC **,** IC (Dependent Clause, comma, Independent Clause)
*   IC DC (Independent Clause, Dependent Clause - often no comma)

## <span style="color: #0073cf;">💡</span> SAT Test-Taking Tips for Sentences & Fragments:

**Identify Key Elements:** For any group of words, always ask:
1.  Is there a **subject**?
2.  Is there a **conjugated verb** that matches the subject and shows tense?

**Simplify:** Mentally remove prepositional phrases and non-essential interrupting phrases to find the core subject and verb.

**Check -ING Words:** Make sure they have a helping verb (*is, are, was, were,* etc.) if they are intended to be the main verb of a clause.

**Watch for Common Fragment Starters:** *Which, who, because, although, if, when,* -ing words at the beginning of a phrase.

> **❗ Remember!** Don't Be Fooled by Length or Meaning: A long group of words can still be a fragment, and a short one can be a sentence. "Making sense" is not the test for grammatical completeness.

Master these rules, and you'll spot those fragments and complete sentences with confidence!

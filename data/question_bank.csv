It correctly calculates the density ratio and applies it to the current weight.,This answer may come from multiplying densities or other calculation errors.,This answer is orders of magnitude too large and results from calculation errors.

By what number must the sum of $X$ and $Y$ be divisible in order for the two equations to have infinitely many solutions?,,,,,,,3,"3 There will be infinitely many solutions if the two equations are multiples of the same equation. The coefficients of the A and B terms in $A + 2B = 4$ add up to 3 because they are 1 and 2. Since $XA + YB = 4X$ is divisible by 4 on the right-hand side, as is the other equation, the sum of $X$ and $Y$ must also be divisible by 3 in order for the two equations to be multiples of one another. To replicate the structure of the first equation, $Y$ must equal $2X$ so that the two equations will be multiples of one another.","For a system of linear equations to have infinitely many solutions, one equation must be a multiple of the other. Let the second equation be $X$ times the first equation. Then we would have $X(A + 2B) = X(4)$, which gives $XA + 2XB = 4X$. Comparing this to the given second equation, $XA + YB = 4X$, we can see that the $XA$ and $4X$ terms match. For the equations to be identical, the B terms must also match: $YB = 2XB$. This means $Y = 2X$. The question asks about the sum $X+Y$. Substituting $Y=2X$, the sum is $X + 2X = 3X$. Since $X$ is an integer, the sum $3X$ must always be divisible by 3.",,,,

She is going to watch the movie as it was shown in movie theaters, in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (length:height). Her television has an aspect ratio of 4:3 and a length of 48 inches. If the movie takes up the entire length of her television screen, how many inches of screen height, to the nearest whole inch, will NOT be used on her TV screen to show the movie?",,10,16,22,44,,10,"(A) The height of Pam’s television is 36 inches, because 48:36 reduces to her screen ratio of 4:3. You can determine how many inches of height the movie image will take up on Pam’s TV by setting up a ratio: $\frac{1}{1.85} = \frac{x}{48} \rightarrow x \approx 26$. Now subtract the height of the movie from the height of the TV screen to determine how many inches of screen height will NOT be used: $36 – 26 = 10$.","1. Find the TV's height. The ratio is length:height = 4:3. $\frac{4}{3} = \frac{48}{h_{TV}} \rightarrow 4h_{TV} = 144 \rightarrow h_{TV} = 36$ inches. 2. Find the movie's height on the screen. The movie uses the full length (48 inches). The ratio is 1.85:1. $\frac{1.85}{1} = \frac{48}{h_{movie}} \rightarrow h_{movie} = \frac{48}{1.85} \approx 25.95$ inches. 3. Find the difference. The unused height is the TV height minus the movie height: $36 - 25.95 = 10.05$ inches. To the nearest whole inch, this is 10.",This is the correct answer. It represents the difference between the TV's height (36) and the movie's height when stretched to the full width (approx. 26).,This value is too high and may result from a calculation error.,"This would be approximately the height of the movie image, not the unused portion of the screen.","This is close to the TV's length, not the unused height."

So $–16 = –8b$, $–6x = –abx$, and $x^2 = x^2$. Why? This occurs because the constants must equal each other, the terms with an x must equal each other, and the terms with an $x^2$ must equal one another. Since $–16 = –8b$, $b = 2$. Plug in 2 for b in the second equation and cancel out the –x to solve for a: $–6x = –abx \rightarrow 6 = a \cdot 2 \rightarrow a = 3$","For this equation to be true for all values of $x$, the coefficients of like terms on both sides must be equal. The $x^2$ terms are already equal. Match the constant terms: $-16 = -8b$. Divide by -8 to get $b=2$. Now match the coefficients of the $x$ terms: $-6x = -abx$. This simplifies to $-6 = -ab$, or $6 = ab$. Substitute the value we found for $b$: $6 = a(2)$. Divide by 2 to find $a$: $a=3$.","This would be the value if $b= -1$, which is incorrect.",This answer may come from a sign error when solving for $b$ or $a$.,"This is the correct answer. It is found by equating the coefficients of the constant terms to find $b$, then equating the coefficients of the $x$ terms to find $a$.",This is an incorrect value for $a$.
